Rather Belated Post-mortem

A couple of my thoughts about my first participation of LD:

Don't Take the Theme Too Seriously

I think I tried to interpret the theme a bit too literary.  I thought
the game has to be *about* minimalism, which means that minimalism is
not about its styles, but the *goal* of the game. What's the problem
with that? It turned out to be difficult to come up with a game design
that is about minimalism but still enjoyable. I thought minimalism
always involves some sort of design or structural construction, which
is a creative act, so the obvious choice for me is to make some kind
of puzzle game.  But I didn't want to make a puzzle game! I wanted to
make an action game.  So this put me into a dilemma. I spent one hour
for brainstorming the basic idea in the beginning, but even after
that, I wasn't really sure what I'm going to do.

The first idea that came to me was a trash compactor. Its goal is to
minimize the volume of garbage, and it can be a game. But it didn't
much sound like minimalism, so I came up another idea, which is to
design a minimalistic house under some condition (think of an artsy
house that modern architects design). I was thinking of something like
"Art Game" by Pippin Bar (http:// ). You push materials around and
then "play" on it. And then at some point, the materials turned into
food, and some crazy insight told me that I should make a platformer
on the top of it. Hence the idea of my game "Controlled Diet" has
come into reality.


You cannot Learn Your Tools Enough

I used a combination of Windows + Linux environment (I run Arch Linux
on VirtualBox on Windows). I edit and compile on a Linux machine and
test it on a Windows machine. I used a vanilla Flex SDK 4.6 and
Makefile (Yes, I am very old school). I used a shell and Python
interpreter, as well as a set of well-known tools (e.g. ImageMagick).
Here are things that I think would be useful if anyone uses a similar
environment like mine:

 * Get used to Emacs' Actionscript-mode.
   There are several versions of it by different authors, and
   they vary slightly in its highlighting and indentation.
   Using a wrong one will end up a lot of annoyance.

 * Use a debug version of standalone Flash Player, so that 
   you can double-click the build and run it directly.

 * Don't forget to add -debug=true compiler option to mxmlc,
   otherwise trace() wouldn't work!

 * Use fdb (Flash command line debugger) to siphon trace()
   outputs to a stdout/file.

 * git config --global core.filemode false

 * If your machine is slow to launch Java, try using fcsh
   (Flash compiler shell), which somewhat reduces the startup time
   of mxmlc (but not by a large margin).

The bottom line is that the more efficient the edit-build-test-debug
cycle, the better. Try to spot the bottlenecks as many as possible and
eliminate them.


IRC is Helpful

I had been lurking around the Ludumdare IRC channel for a couple of
weeks, and I can tell that this is a very nice place to hang out. You
see a lot of people talking about their ideas. At one point I was
murmuring about the need of creating a quad-tree implementation that
was necessary for my simplistic physics engine. Then someone in the
chat said "a quadtree is overkill for this", and he was right; I
didn't really need a quadtree for only a dozen of objects. Now I want
to thank that person. You saved me a lot of time.


Things that Went Okay

 * Overall framework. I wrote a generic framework and posted it on
   github beforehand. This strategy went well. I can start quickly
   tweaking on a working codebase, and it was simple enough to allow
   me to change it drastically later on.

 * Time management. I put a TODO list on my desktop and tried to
   update it at every hour. Later I had to reorder things but this
   helped me greatly to stay focused on what I'm going to do.

 * autotracker.py. This is an awesome tool, even more so when you know
   a bit of Python and how to tweak it. Thanks a lot.


Believe in Your Idea, with Passion

Generally, I think I'm more of an "idea" guy. I wanted to come up with
a wacky, eccentric idea and somehow I succeeded in it. I finished my
game, and even its not the most fun thing to play, I still enjoyed the
whole process a lot. Hope I can do this next time again.
